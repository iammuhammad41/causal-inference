### Explanation:

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**:

   * We created a synthetic dataset where `treatment` affects the `outcome`. The treatment is influenced by two confounders (`w0` and `w1`), and the outcome depends on the treatment and the confounders.

2. **Causal Model with DoWhy**:

   * We used **DoWhy** to create a causal graph specifying the causal relationships between `treatment`, `outcome`, and the confounders (`w0`, `w1`).
   * We identified the causal effect of `treatment` on `outcome` using the **backdoor criterion** and estimated it using **linear regression**.

3. **Causal Estimation**:

   * The causal effect was estimated using the **backdoor.linear\_regression** method.
   * We plotted the estimated causal effect using DoWhy's plotting tools.

4. **Refutation Test**:

   * We performed a **placebo treatment refuter** test to check the robustness of our estimated causal effect by randomly treating the data and ensuring that the estimate remains unchanged.

5. **Advanced Estimation with EconML (DML)**:

   * We used **EconML**'s **Double Machine Learning (DML)** estimator, which applies machine learning models to estimate the causal effect. We utilized **Random Forests** for both the outcome and treatment models and **Lasso Regression** for the final model.

6. **DML Refutation**:

   * We applied a refutation method using **EconML** to test the robustness of our DML estimate.

### Output:

* The script prints the **identified estimand**, **causal estimate**, and results from **refutation tests**.
* It also visualizes the **causal effect** using DoWhy and plots the results from **EconML**'s DML estimator.

## Requirements:

1. **DoWhy**: Used for causal inference modeling.
2. **EconML**: Advanced causal effect estimators.
3. **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models used in DML.
4. **matplotlib**: For plotting the results.
