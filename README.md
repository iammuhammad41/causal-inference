Explanation:
Synthetic Data Generation:

We created a synthetic dataset where treatment affects the outcome. The treatment is influenced by two confounders (w0 and w1), and the outcome depends on the treatment and the confounders.

Causal Model with DoWhy:

We used DoWhy to create a causal graph specifying the causal relationships between treatment, outcome, and the confounders (w0, w1).

We identified the causal effect of treatment on outcome using the backdoor criterion and estimated it using linear regression.

Causal Estimation:

The causal effect was estimated using the backdoor.linear_regression method.

We plotted the estimated causal effect using DoWhy's plotting tools.

Refutation Test:

We performed a placebo treatment refuter test to check the robustness of our estimated causal effect by randomly treating the data and ensuring that the estimate remains unchanged.

Advanced Estimation with EconML (DML):

We used EconML's Double Machine Learning (DML) estimator, which applies machine learning models to estimate the causal effect. We utilized Random Forests for both the outcome and treatment models and Lasso Regression for the final model.

DML Refutation:

We applied a refutation method using EconML to test the robustness of our DML estimate.

Output:
The script prints the identified estimand, causal estimate, and results from refutation tests.

It also visualizes the causal effect using DoWhy and plots the results from EconML's DML estimator.
